                In todayâ€™s unpredictable sourcing environment, stability and
                agility are key. Retailers, having experienced volatile shipping
                and supply chains over the last few years, are focused on
                safeguarding their production processes. Nearshoring has emerged
                as a powerful strategy, allowing for more responsive
                manufacturing timelines and fewer inventory issues.

                We are proud to partner with WWF - Pakistan to promote Water
                Stewardship among the vulnerable communities of Karachi. We
                recognize the critical importance of preserving and managing our
                freshwater resources. Our partnership with WWF - Pakistan is
                focused on implementing strategic water stewardship practices
                that not only benefit our operations but also support the
                broader community and ecosystem. We engaged with various
                stakeholders, including neighboring companies and local
                communities, to share insights and collaborate on innovative
                water management strategies. Our goal is to foster a collective
                approach to address water-related challenges and promote best
                practices.
