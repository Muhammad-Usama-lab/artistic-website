            leaders to define our sustainability goals and build a strategy for
            success. We work with the world's leading third-party assessors to

            Artistic Milliners has played a major role in renewable energy in
            Pakistan. Our current and in-process renewable energy projects play
            a pivotal role in shifting away from energy generated from imported
            fossil fuels, substituting carbon emissions, and reducing the cost
            of energy generation.
